        <p class="guide-description">
          Festivals are full of energy, but staying safe is key to having a good time. Keep your phone charged, use a
          buddy system, and always know where the first aid and exit points are. Avoid accepting drinks from strangers
          and keep your belongings in a secure, zipped bag.

        <h3 class="guide-title">Festival Essentials: What to Pack?</h3>
        <p class="guide-description">
          From sunscreen to a reusable water bottle, don’t leave your essentials behind. Bring portable chargers,
          earplugs, a small towel, and a waterproof poncho. A bum bag or small backpack will keep everything handy
          without weighing you down.

        <h3 class="guide-title">Budget-Friendly Festival Tips</h3>
        <p class="guide-description">
          You don’t need to spend a fortune to enjoy festivals. Buy early-bird tickets, bring your own snacks, camp
          instead of booking hotels, and split transportation with friends. Plan ahead and dance without financial
          stress.
